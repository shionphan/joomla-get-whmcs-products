# Joomla plugin for getting all products from WHMCS

## Update

1. 2020-02-06 Create product demo file.

## USEAGE

* Put the myproducts.php in the WHMCS root directory;
* Visit https://yourdomain.com/myproducts.php;
* Get the data as shown in the screenshot;
* Use web front-end framework for development in clientareaproducts.tpl file. Maybe Vue and Angular are great framework;
* Visit https://yourdomain.com/clientarea.php?action=products&page=1;

## IDEAS

1. Create a custom php page in WHMCS;
2. Echo json data by Capsule::table();
3. Achieve user experience by requesting this interface asynchronously in clientareaproducts.tpl;
